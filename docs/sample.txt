Sample
======

This module implements the random sampling of structures from a ``Compound's``
ensemble according to its Boltzmann distribution.

Example usage
-------------

We now want to sample secondary structures from a ``Compound``.

.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  var
    # The compound in question.
    c: Compound = ...

  # Let's get ourselves a few thousand samples:
  for idx in 0 ..< 10_000:
    let
      res = c.sample
    ... # Do something to the sample.
