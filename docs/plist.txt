InteractionList
===============

This module implements procedures for the ``InteractionList`` and ``PairList``
types, which allow to access interactions in a ``Compound``, with their types
and probabilities. Such interactions can be base pairs or G-quadruplexes.
It also implements maximum expected accuracy folding, based on an
``InteractionList``.

Example usage
-------------

We want to extract the maximum expectad accuracy fold of a ``Compound``.

.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  var
    c: Compound = ... # The Compound in quesion.
    plist = c.pairList

  let
    # Do the folding:
    (accuracy, structure) = plist.mea
