Eval
=====

This module contains procedures to evaluate the energy of a nucleic acid
sequence folded into a particular secondary structure, as well as the difference
in energy yielded by adding or removing base pairs to a secondary structure.

Example usage
-------------

Let's see if we can evaluate how well a sequence fits to a secondary structure:

.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  proc fitness(c: Compound; structure: string): float =
    ## Compute E_structure - E_ensemble.
    let
      targetEnergy = c.eval(structure)
      (ensembleEnergy, _) = c.pf
    return targetEnergy - ensembleEnergy
