Fold
=====

This module contains all procedures for folding a ``Compound``. That is, minimum
free energy folding, partition function folding and centroid folding, for monomers
and dimers.

Example usage
-------------

Those are a few variations on folding.

.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  var
    comp: Compound = compound"..."
    dimer: Compound = dimer("...", "...")

  # A few variations on folding.
  let
    (E, struc) = comp.mfe # Minimum free energy fold
    (Epf, strucPf) = comp.pf # partition function fold
    (distance, struc) = comp.centroid # ensemble centroid
