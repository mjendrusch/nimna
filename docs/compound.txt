Compound
========

This module contains the ``Compound`` types, constructors and accessors for
those types. The procedures in this module will be used in almost any possible
use-case for ``nimna``.

Example usage
-------------

Those are the ways ``Compounds`` can be created.

.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  let
    monomer = compound"some sequence ..."
    dimer = dimer("some sequence ...", "some other sequence ...")
    alsoADimer = compound"some sequence ...&some other sequence ..."
