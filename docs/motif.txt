Motif
=====

This module implements structured and unstructured sequence-motif based
constraints. It works just like soft constraints, by assigning a free energy
to a sequence motif.

Example usage
-------------
Let's say we have an RNA sequence containing an aptamer with known fold and
free energy of binding. We want to add that aptamer as a motif constraint.

The aptamer structure and sequence:

.. code-block ::
  structure ASCII art:

    5'  3'
    C---G
    G---C
   A    U C G G 5'
  A    /  | | |
   A  A   G C C 3'

  sequence:
           v
  CGAAAAGCC&GGCUCG
          ---
  structure:
           v
  ((...((((&))))))
          ---
            \_ `&` indicates a sequence split.


.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  # The aptamer's binding free energy.
  const energy = -2.37 # kcal / mol

  var
    c: Compound = ... # The Compound.

  # Set the constraint:
  c.preferMotif("CGAAAAGCC&GGCUCG",
                "((...((((&))))))",
                energy)
