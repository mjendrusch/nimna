Alignment
=========

This module provides constructors and accessors for ``Alignment`` objects,
which represent multiple sequence alignments. ``Alignments`` are read from
file using the ``alignment`` procedure, where the file can be any of the
usual multiple sequence alignment formats.

Example usage
-------------

Let's read an alignment, and fold it into a consensus secondary structure.

.. code-block :: nim
  import nimna

  let
    align = alignment"algn.fasta"
    comp = compound align
    # Just use minimum free energy folding
    # with an alignment compound for the
    # consensus secondary structure.
    (energy, structure) = comp.mfe
