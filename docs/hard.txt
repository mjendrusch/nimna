Hard
=====

This module implements hard constraints for ``Compound`` folding, i.e. allows
you to force given bases to pair.

Example usage
-------------

We want part of a sequence to fold into a stem loop, and use hard constraints
to accomplish that.

.. code-block ::
  sequence & structure:
                 T
             A       G
              C --- G
              G --- C
              C --- G
              G --- C
  5' G A T C G        A A G 3'
  constraint string: .....((((xxx))))...
  'x' means base pairing is forbidden.

.. code-block :: Nim
  import nimna

  var
    c = compound"GATCGGCGCATGGCGCAAG"
    (energy, structure) = c.constrain(".....((((xxx))))...").mfe
