Settings
========

This module implements facilities to set a ``Compound's`` folding parameters.
To that end, it provides the ``settings`` macro, which allows to declaratively
set any folding parameters desired.

Example usage
--------------

Here, we apply settings to a ``Compound``, setting the temperature to `37 Â°C`
and forbidding ``G --- U`` base pairs.

.. code-block :: nim
  let
    opts = settings(
      temperature = 37.0, # Set the temperature.
      noGU = 1 # Forbid G --- U base pairs.
    )
   rnaOfInterest = compound"... the sequence ...".update(opts)
