Subopt
======

This module provides procedures for suboptimal nucleic acid folding. Given a
``Compound`` and a maximum energy deviation from the minimum free energy given
in integer multiples of `0.01 kcal / mol`, one can compute a set of
suboptimal solutions to the folding problem within that range.

Example usage
-------------

Let's say we have a possibly multi-stable RNA sequence and want to see all
solutions within `1 kcal / mol` of the minimum free energy at
`37 Â°C`, as that is the temperature we would like to use it at.

.. code-block :: nim
  import strformat
  import nimna

  let
    rnaOfInterest = compound"... the sequence ...".update settings(
      temperature = 37.0 # Set the temperature.
    )
    solutions = rnaOfInterest.suboptimals(100) # Get the suboptimal solutions.

  ## Iterate over the solutions and retrieve their information:
  for (energy, structure) in solutions:
    echo fmt"Fold with energy: {energy} [kcal / mol] and structure: {structure}"
