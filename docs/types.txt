Types
=====

This module provides the basic garbage-collected wrapper types used in ``nimna``.
It contains the following important type definitions:

``Compound`` (`Compound <nimna_compound.html>`_)
  The core type of the ``nimna`` API. It represents a fully parameterized
  nucleic acid sequence, to be folded and analysed using the procedures in
  nimna. Internally, it stores a pointer to a ``vrna_fold_compound_t`` object
  of the ViennaRNA API, as well as a set of flags, to track the object's status
  to only perform necessary recomputations and return precomupted results
  otherwise.

``Compound2D`` (`Compound <nimna_compound.html>`_)
  Same as ``Compound``, but used for two-dimensional folding, i.e. folding
  with respect to two reference sequences.

``CompoundComparative`` (`Compound <nimna_compound.html>`_)
  Same as ``Compound``, but used for comparative folding of multiple sequences,
  i.e. of a multiple sequence ``Alignment``.

``Alignment`` (`Alignment <nimna_alignment.html>`_)
  Represents a multiple sequence alignment, storing a list of sequences and
  their identifying names, together with a consensus secondary structure.

``Suboptimals`` (`Suboptimals <nimna_subopt.html>`_)
  Represents a list of suboptimal folds of a sequence.

``InteractionList`` (`InteractionList <nimna_interactionlist.html>`_)
  Represents a list of base interactions, those being base pairings, or
  G-quadruplexes.

``Settings`` (`Settings <nimna_model.html>`_)
  Represents a set of settings to be used for folding. For the set of available
  parameters, see the `ViennaRNA documentation`_.

``Probabilities`` (`Probabilities <nimna_probabilities.html>`_)
  The a view into the base pair probability matrix of a ``Compound``, generated
  using partition function folding. As long as it is alive, its parent
  ``Compound`` may not be garbage collected. This is useful for assessing the
  probability of certain base-pairs existing, for example for fitness functions
  for nucleic acid design.
