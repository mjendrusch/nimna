Probabilities
=============

This module implements ``Probabilities``, an immutable view into a ``Compound's``
probability matrix. It holds a reference to its parent ``Compound`` to make sure
it does not outlive it. The module provides accessors and iterators, so the
``Probability`` object handles just as an array would.

Example usage
-------------

We have an RNA sequence and want to know the probabilities of base pairing for
some base pairs.

.. code-block :: nim
  import strformat
  import nimna

  var
    c: Compound = ... # The RNA sequence in question.
    prob = c.probabilities

  for idx in 0 ..< c.len div 2:
    let
      onStemProbability = prob[idx, c.len - idx]
    echo fmt"Probability for base pair on diagonal: {onStemProbability}"
